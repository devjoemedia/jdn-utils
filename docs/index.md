# Kenx Documentation

Kenx project aims to do three things.

1. Simple and seamless setup of a web application
2. Provide useful development assistance tools
3. Promise easy maintenance to others

Base on years of experience, from different developers coming from different backgrounds, we thought putting together Kenx around these three things will help speed up development and create better web applications. Do less work, focus on only what matters and make the best provisions for the future.

We are not whole alone. Improvement and support from eath other, are the bases on which we keep up on doing great things. So, we've put up the following documentations to help you figure out how it all works and where you can best be helpful.
